Suppose you were getting kinda sick of an ever growing 'applyPTF.out' file inside
your WebSphere for z/OS filesystem (a zFS I hope).

Suppose you wanted to have this file to have a new name every time you started your WAS.

Furthermore, suppose you did't want to go about and change all your STC JCL.

In that case I advise you to take a look at [zdynlink](https://github.com/wizardofzos/zdynlink) on my github page.

Go ahead, install it, then run it against your applyPTF.out. 

You'll be happy :)

Special thanks to @bas_otten for coming up with a name for this 'tool' :)

Sidenote : This is the first result of RD4ZUT running here at zdevops! Stay tuned for more mainframe awesomeness!
