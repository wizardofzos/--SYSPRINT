title: Installing RD4z on Ubuntu 64

Rational Developer for System z. Something you need to buy at IBM if
you want to run "Unit Test".

Seeing as I like Unit Tests a lot, you can understand my love for RDzUT :)

It's basically a legal, supported Hercules running legal z/OS 1.12 code and
a lot of subsystems. We're talking WebSphere, CICS, DB2 and the such :)

Uber to say the least.

So before I dove into installing the UnitTest Feature it seemed all but fair 
to install the Ration Developer first.

As per IBM's stated prereqs one should install this on RHEL, SLED or Windows.

Windows was never an option, and I've tried SLED, however this SLED would just
not let me use the wireless in my 'inst'-machine (an HP dv7-1070ed)

So I've decided to install it on Ubuntu 64. (version 11.02).

Guess what? It totally works :)

There's two things to keep in mind however :

1. IBM Installation Manager *needs* 32bit libraries
2. Rational Developer needs the 32bit version of _libstdc++.so.5_

So get yourself a clean install of Ubuntu64, or use your current one if you wish.

Before even inserting your disks issue these two commands and Bob will be your Uncle.

    sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.5 /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5

Stay tuned for more awesomness :)
