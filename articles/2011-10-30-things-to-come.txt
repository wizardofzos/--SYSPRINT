Whoa there! Looks like you found my hide-out here on heroku.
Congratulations! For the time being I most probably will be experimenting locally with this uber-awesome weblog thinggy called 'toto'.
If you want to host your own weblog on heroku hop on over to <http://cloudhead.io/toto> and get yourself up and running in under 10 seconds.

Well that's assuming you got some prerequisites running, but after reading the basic install guide on their website you'll soon catch te drift.

Basically all you do is :

    git clone git://github.com/cloudhead/dorothy.git myblog
    cd myblog
    heroku create myblog
    git push heroku master

Is that is? Yeah that's it. Well after that you go into the whole thing of changing the theme to your liking.
I'll start doing that too. Or as you will discover once you 'roll your own' I've already applied some tweaking.

But that's not what this site is about.
 It's a site about Awesomeness & The Mainframe.

 eeek!

 That can't be right :)

 Stay tuned and find out!
