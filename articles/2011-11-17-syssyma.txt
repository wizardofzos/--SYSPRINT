Pop Quiz :  In order to answer this, log on with your favorite telnet client and
connect to a USS environment (I just heard we cannot use this term).

Anyway:

    cd /tmp
    ln -s '$SYSSYMA/tmp/test-D&YYMMDD.-T&HHMMSS..txt' test
    touch test
    ls -l test*
    lrwxrexrwx   1  IBMUSER  SYS1             44 Nov 17 14:49 test -> $SYSSYMA/tmp/test-D&YYDDMM.-T&HHMMSS..txt
    -rw-r-----   1  IBMUSER  SYS1              0 Nov 17 14:51 test-D111117-T135004.txt


### Question 1:

Do you get what's going on here?

### Question 2:

What triggers the 'resetting' of the HHMMSS variable? Repeated writes to /tmp/test will not *all* generate
unique files.

### Question 3:

What causes the mismatch in 'file time' (14:51) and 'file name time' (13:50:04)?


I'll be reading your comments...
