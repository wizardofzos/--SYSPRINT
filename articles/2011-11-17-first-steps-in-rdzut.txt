Being a mainframe addict for over 15 years now it was about time to start running z/OS privately.

I know there are ways to be doing this the 'shady' way, by running some torrented CCKD
files with the [Hercules](http://www.hercules-390.org/) emulator. However besided being illegal, it's no good when using
it professionally. I've been there, and I've done that, but it was time to start doing things the proper way.

So after spending quite some time finding an IBM Business Partner selling me the product at the lowest
possible price I made the purchase of "Rational Developer for System Z" with the "Unit Test Feature".

Long story short, this gave me a fully functional z/Arch emulator for an x86-64 system.

Basically, I'm now running z/OS 1.11 right from my desktop. And let me tell you, it's *frigging Awesome*.

On this website you will be able to gradually read up on my endeavors regarding my 'private' Mainframe. 

For now, I will leave you with the remarkt I've got it up and running. And yes, with full TCP/IP in and(!) out.
Stay tuned to read all about the upcoming projects "ofacebk", "otwttr", "zGit" and "zRedis"...

There are still umpteen problems to tackle, for one buying this 'Private Mainframe' does not entitle you to a 
"shop zSeries" account. This basically means I cannot download any ptfs or (and this might even be the biggest
issue) get my hands on "the ported tools". 

Seeing as I want to start on getting things like git and redis running on the z/OS system running here this is 
somewhat of a 'showstopper'.

Luckily however I got my good friend Greg looking for solutions to this issue so we might get rolling after all!

Untill then,



Keep being proud of all the awesome things you do!
