So I was asking myself who would still tweet about OS/390?
I mean it's like tweeting about old stuff :)

Stuff people using twitter are not very likely to tweet about.

To my great suprise I found a lot of tweets about OS/390 by
people beyond my imagination. Take Kristle Juntunen for example.

She doesn't look like your average Database Administrator, yet she tweets
about a book regarding performance tweaks on DB2 for OS/390.

My conclusion : Mostly Sexy Babes tweet about OS/390
