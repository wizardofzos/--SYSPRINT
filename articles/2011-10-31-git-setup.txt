title: Git Setup
date: 31/10/2011

So in order to do some handy gitting I use the following aliasses given to me, free of charge by my good friend @nvie.
These reduce the number of keystrokes I have to do to mess up my git-repos :)

I've stored a little .sh over at <https://github.com/wizardofzos/Git-up> so I can set these at any of the machines I am using git on.

This post will most probably dissapear in the near future :)
