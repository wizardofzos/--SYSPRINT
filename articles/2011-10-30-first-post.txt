That's just great. Nothing more than the following commands to set up this here blog.

    git clone git://github.com/cloudhead/dorothy.git sysprint
    cd sysprint
    heroku create sysprint
    git push heroku master

And all of a sudden _Bob was my Uncle_. From now on I can manage my blog via 
the raw vim interface, whilst using git to push it to heroku. Giving me free
version control on my blog aswell.

Up next : 

1. Alter the theme
1. Enable _Disqus_ commenting **done**
1. Change title for main page (so its not app)
1. ....

You'll be reading more here soon :)
